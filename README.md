This project implements a fully functional Mail Server in C, designed to handle user authentication, email message management, and concurrent interactions between multiple clients and servers. It integrates key operating system concepts such as multi-processing, multithreading, inter-process communication, process synchronization, deadlock management, virtual memory, and scheduling. The server efficiently manages concurrent connections, ensures smooth process synchronization, optimizes memory usage, and schedules tasks for optimal performance. This project practically implements OS principles, providing a strong foundation for understanding mail server operations and concurrent system design.
